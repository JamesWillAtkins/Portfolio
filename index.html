        <h3>Uk Based Company Finder</h3>
        <p>I was commissioned to create a web based application that would list companys information based on their SIC code. The specfic companys my client was looking for was Steel trading companys. To complete this task I used a mixture of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python in order to respond with the API.
